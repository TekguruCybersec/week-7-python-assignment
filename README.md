Basic Data Analysis and Visualization
This project provides a Python script for performing basic data analysis and creating visualizations using the diabetes.csv dataset. The script demonstrates how to compute descriptive statistics, group data, and generate various plots to understand data patterns.

Features
Data Loading: Loads data from a diabetes.csv file.

Basic Statistics: Computes descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for key numerical columns using pandas.

Grouped Analysis: Groups data by a categorical variable (Outcome) to compare mean values of numerical columns.

Data Visualization: Generates four types of plots to visualize the data:

Bar Chart: Compares mean values between categories.

Histogram: Shows the distribution of a numerical column.

Scatter Plot: Visualizes the relationship between two numerical variables.

Line Chart: Demonstrates how to plot a trend (used here for sample index vs. BMI).

Requirements
To run this script, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

You can install them using pip:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

Dataset
This script requires the diabetes.csv file to be present in the same directory as the script. The dataset is a well-known health-related dataset used for machine learning and data analysis.

Usage
Place the data_analysis.py script and the diabetes.csv file in the same directory.

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory containing the files.

Run the script using the following command:

python data_analysis.py

The script will print the statistical analysis results and display the generated plots.#
